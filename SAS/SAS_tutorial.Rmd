#Canonical structures of the first pair of canonical variate and F-test (full group)

The output below gives the canonical correlations and the multivariate tests of the dimensions, and also includes the multivariate criteria and the F approximations.

Next, the raw canonical coefficients are shown below.

The raw canonical coefficients are interpreted in a manner analogous to interpreting regression coefficients. For the variable **Albumin**, a one unit increase in **Albumin** leads to a 0.9655 increase in the first canonical variate of set 2 when all of the other variables are held constant. 


The raw coefficients are followed by the standardized canonical coefficients shown below.

Below are correlations between observed variables and canonical variables which are known as the canonical loadings, which SAS labels as the canonical structure.
